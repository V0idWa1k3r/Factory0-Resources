# Factory0 - Resources

Factory 0 - resources is a mod that adds ores to your world. But it does it differently from other mods - it adds the ores to the chunk directly as an abstract number rather then adding them as blocks in a world.
These ores can then be extracted from the chunk using a Deep Core Drill.
Ore generation is based on Simplex Noise.
Additionally the mod is highly configurable with the ability to add any item as an ore that will get generated in the world, tweak everything there is in the mod and add custom drill heads - all via configuration!
